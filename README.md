This project has been discontinued due to the fact I am reinventing the wheel. JMonkey engine is
basically the exact same thing. This will be retained for reference like the other discontinued projects on
this repository but will likely be deleted later.

This is an open source game engine written in Java.
The engine is modular and uses a package management system similar to the Linux or OSGI package management system.
It is designed to be able to allow games written with the engine to be inherently multiplatform.
The goal here is to create another game engine similar to JMonkey that further proves Java can be used
to write quality games. It should be easy enough to use that beginner programmers can delve into game
development and advanced programmers can use the more powerful aspects of the engine to save a lot of time
developing the more redundant aspects of the game development process.
The modular layout allows each system to be updated independently, forces code to be cleaner,
and allows the engine to be easily extended by third parties.
