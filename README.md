=====
This project has been scrapped. The code has been moved and is now being used in the Omega Editor project. The game development, if continued, will be done in Unity and the contents of this repository will henceforth reflect the new environment. It is unclear if git is still going to be used for verison control on the new project as it is still in the design phase.
