Ikala
=====
An extension of the core Ikala libraries that add functionality that is useful for games. These are intended to provide functionality to speed up game development and performance of games.

The `jars` directory contains exported jars of the source and libraries needed for the source to work. The jar also includes source files for convenience. `Ikala.jar` is the source jar with libraries and all, and the `Ikala-javadoc.jar` contains javadoc.

For information about how the libraries work and how they are used, check out the wiki. More specific details, such as about classes and methods, can be found in the javadoc.
